# Weather-App
A sleek and responsive weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app displays the current temperature, city, humidity, wind speed, and dynamically changes the background and icon based on the weather condition â€” complete with animated gradient effects.
